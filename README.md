# transcend-exe
A twitter bot that tweets out some sick, philosophical and transcendentalist (vaguely nihilistic) sentiments generated by a recurrent neural network. 

# How to Set-Up
The RNN was forked from https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn! You will need to install torch, luarocks and other dependencies to run the recurrent neural network. Please follow the tutorial in the link to set it up -- this tutorial is recommended if you are running on a mac OS: http://www.jeffreythompson.org/blog/2016/03/25/torch-rnn-mac-install/.
