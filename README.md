# Meet transcend-exe, a Twitterbot 
A twitter bot that tweets out some sick, philosophical and transcendentalist (vaguely nihilistic) sentiments generated by a recurrent neural network. 

# Goals 
- To learn how recurrent neural networks function, what the implentation looks like, what the results could be and what we can learn from the outputs.  
- To successfuly set up the environment and troubleshoot when necessary
- To create a functioning Twitterbot for the first time (for the future, will be on the backburner for now) 

# How to Set Up
The RNN was forked from https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn! You will need to install torch, luarocks and other dependencies to run the recurrent neural network. Please follow the tutorial in the link to set it up -- this tutorial is recommended if you are running on a mac OS: http://www.jeffreythompson.org/blog/2016/03/25/torch-rnn-mac-install/.
